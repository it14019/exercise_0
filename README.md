PROBLEM 1

Defining strict types, so that returned value is always integer. Sometimes string '6' also counts as number.
Looping through $numbers array looking for a value, which have different parity comparing to the next one.
If value doesn't match conditions, an error will be thrown. If it matches, the index of value will be found and returned.

PROBLEM 2

Passing array with values in constructor. In method sum() two arguments are passed, which will define
from which and to which position array will be spliced and then sums these values together.

PROBLEM 3

Looping through string characters and finding the last position of character, which occurs more than 1 time in string.
Then taking characters from 1st position until position, where occurs character, which is more than 1 time in string
and output the result.
